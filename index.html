This is a page for unofficial experimental RSS feed of old episodes(up to 343) of Hollywood Babble-On podcast with Ralf Garman and Kevin Smith.<br>
Disclaimer: I don't host the mp3 files. Stitcher does. <br>
I don't know why they did not remove them yet since they don't have an exclusive contract with Smith for years now.<br>
This feed is an experiment and is not guarantied to be here forever.<br>
As soon as the files are taken down it will make no sense to continue hosting it.<br>
Enjoy while it lasts.<br>
The feed link:<br>
https://lol-prog.github.io/podcasts/hbo.xml<br>
Add it to your favourite podcast app if it supports RSS and have fun.<br>
Note: the dates in the feed are fake. They are needed to sort the episode correctly, but files metadata is inconsistently populated.<br>
There's no way to easily extract all the correct dates.
