<title>Unofficial Kevin Smith podcasts RSS</title>
</head>
<body>
This is a page for unofficial experimental RSS feeds of old episodes of the following podcasts:
<ul>
    <li>Hollywood Babble-On</li>
    <li>Fatman on Batman / Fatman Beyond</li>
    <li>Edumacation</li>
</ul>
Disclaimer: I don't host the mp3 files. Stitcher does. <br>
I don't know why they did not remove them yet since they don't have an exclusive contract with Smith for years now.<br>
This feed is an experiment and is not guarantied to be here forever.<br>
As soon as the files are taken down it will make no sense to continue hosting it.<br>
Enjoy while it lasts.<br>
The feeds:<br><br>

https://lol-prog.github.io/podcasts/fatman.xml<br>
https://lol-prog.github.io/podcasts/edumacation.xml<br><br>
Add needed feed to your favourite podcast app if it supports RSS and have fun.<br>
Note: the dates in the feed are fake. They are needed to sort the episodes correctly, but files' metadata is inconsistently populated.<br>
There's no way to easily extract all the correct dates.
